# Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis – Git Hub Readme
## 🏨  Hotel Booking Cancellation Analysis (Excel-Based Project)
### 📌 Project Overview

This project analyzes hotel booking cancellations using an Excel-based analytical workflow to uncover patterns, drivers, and actionable insights that help hotels reduce cancellations, improve revenue forecasting, and optimize operational decisions.

The analysis demonstrates strong fundamentals in data analysis, business thinking, and storytelling, making it an excellent portfolio project for Data Analyst / Data Scientist / Business Analyst roles.

### 🎯 Business Problem

Hotel booking cancellations lead to:

Revenue loss

Poor demand forecasting

Inefficient room allocation

Goal: Identify why customers cancel bookings and how hotels can proactively reduce cancellations.

### 📊  Dataset Description

The dataset (Excel spreadsheet) contains historical hotel booking data with features such as:

Category	Example Fields
Booking Info	Hotel Type, Lead Time, Booking Date
Customer Info	Market Segment, Country
Stay Details	Number of Nights, Room Type
Pricing	ADR (Average Daily Rate)
Outcome	Cancellation Status

Dataset is structured and cleaned directly in Excel using formulas, filters, and pivot tables.

### 🧠  Key Questions Answered

Which customer segments cancel the most?

Which hotel type has higher cancellation rates?

How does lead time affect cancellation probability?

Does pricing influence cancellations?

Are repeat guests less likely to cancel?

🛠️ ### Tools & Techniques Used
🔹 Excel (Core Tool)

Data Cleaning (handling missing values, formatting)

Pivot Tables & Pivot Charts

Conditional Formatting

Logical & Statistical Functions

Sorting, Filtering, Grouping

🔹 Analytical Skills Demonstrated

Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

KPI creation (Cancellation Rate, Booking Volume)

Business Insight Generation

📈 ### Key Insights

✔️ High lead time bookings cancel more frequently

✔️ City hotels show higher cancellation rates compared to resort hotels

✔️ Online travel agent (OTA) bookings cancel more than direct bookings

✔️ Repeat guests have significantly lower cancellation rates

✔️ Higher ADR bookings are more prone to cancellation

💡 ### Business Recommendations

Implement dynamic cancellation policies based on lead time

Offer incentives for early commitment
